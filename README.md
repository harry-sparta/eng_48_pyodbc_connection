# Modules, Libraries and Packages
## --> Specifically pyodbc package

## Libraries
Refer to python standard libraries.
They come standard with python but need to be imported.

### Modules
These are python files / like our MonsterStudent that we import into our programs.
We create and import our own modules internally.

### Packages
These are external modules, that we need to install (externally) and then import them.

These are modules usually written in OOP style, that abstract something 

These things that are abstracted include:
- Connection to a service (google maps, google image recognition api, price of stocks or price of bitcoin.)
- Tools or calculators (prime number calculator, other complex calculators)
- Front-end tools - Like JS compiler or other things like scss.
- Full fledge frameworks
- connection to Databases or using HTTP protocols
